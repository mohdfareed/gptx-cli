# GPTx CLI Code Review

## Overview

This document tracks our ongoing code review and simplification efforts for the GPTx CLI project. We'll use this to document our findings, track concerns, and guide refactoring decisions.

## Current Architecture

- **CLI layer** (`cmd/gptx/`): User-facing commands and flags
- **Core logic** (`pkg/gptx/`): Business logic and configuration
- **OpenAI API** (`pkg/openai/`): Thin abstraction over the OpenAI API

## Progress Update (May 12, 2025)

We've made significant progress in refining the core architecture and implementing key components:

1. **Configuration System**
   - Refined the environment variable handling using struct field tags
   - Improved serialization for consistent env variable naming
   - Maintained hierarchical config file loading for Git-like experience

2. **Events System**
   - Implemented a minimal, channel-based event system
   - Focused on core lifecycle events: prompt, response, completion
   - Added tool execution events for extensibility
   - Followed Go idioms with direct channels rather than complex abstractions

3. **File Tagging**
   - Reviewed the file tagging implementation and confirmed its elegance
   - Tag system allows for inline file references with line range specifications

## Initial Observations

- Configuration system uses multiple layers (env vars, config files, CLI flags)
- Event system has been implemented with a minimalist channel-based approach
- Tools framework has minimal implementation so far
- File attachment handling is implemented with a clean tagging system
- CLI structure follows urfave/cli patterns with commands for messaging, config display, and demo UI

## Areas Reviewed

- [x] Configuration complexity (multiple sources: env vars, config files in multiple locations, CLI flags)
- [x] Events system necessity and implementation
- [ ] Tools framework approach (current implementation is minimal)
- [x] File attachment handling with tagging system
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] CLI command structure
- [ ] Overall code organization

## Simplification Decisions

1. **Configuration System**:
   - **Decision**: Kept hierarchical config loading for Git-like behavior
   - **Implementation**: Uses struct field env tags as the source of truth for environment variable names
   - **Benefit**: Simplified serialization while maintaining flexibility

2. **Events System**:
   - **Decision**: Implemented a minimal channel-based system
   - **Implementation**: Direct Go channels with minimal structures for the core lifecycle events
   - **Benefit**: Simple, idiomatic Go approach without unnecessary abstractions

3. **File Attachments**:
   - **Decision**: Maintained the current tagging approach
   - **Implementation**: Regex-based tag processing for inline file references
   - **Benefit**: Elegant user experience for file inclusion

## Model Interaction Lifecycle

We've defined a clear model interaction lifecycle with these phases:

1. **Prompt**: User provides input, possibly with file tags
2. **Response**: Model generates streaming text chunks
3. **Tool Usage** (optional):
   - Model requests a tool
   - CLI executes the tool
   - Result is returned to model
4. **Completion**: Final response or error is delivered

This lifecycle is now reflected in our events system implementation with corresponding channels.

## In-depth Analysis

### Configuration System
Configuration is loaded from multiple sources with a consistent naming scheme. The system now uses:

- Struct field `env` tags as the source of truth for naming
- Consistent naming between JSON serialization and environment variables
- Hierarchical file loading following Git-like behavior

**Implementation**: Enhanced the `EnvVar()` function to handle struct fields and provide consistent naming throughout the application.

### Events System
The events system has been implemented with a focus on simplicity:

- Direct Go channels for each event type
- Minimal structures for tool-related events
- Non-blocking pattern for event emission
- Clean separation between event producers and consumers

**Implementation**: A focused `Events` struct with channels for each key event in the model lifecycle.

### File Context & Tagging System
The tagging system (`@file(path:start-end)`) continues to provide:

1. **Inline file references**: Users can embed file snippets directly in their prompts
2. **Targeted excerpts**: Supports line range specification for focused context
3. **Future extensibility**: Architecture allows for new tag types beyond files

The implementation remains clean and targeted.

### OpenAI Integration
The OpenAI integration is well-structured with:
- Clean handling of file attachments
- Stream parsing for real-time responses
- Good abstraction over the Responses API

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Model Interaction**
   - Implement the core model interaction in the `msg` command
   - Connect events system to the UI for response streaming

2. **Tools Framework**
   - Design and implement a clean interface for tool execution
   - Start with basic web search and shell command tools
   - Integrate with the events system for lifecycle management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement consistent error handling throughout the application
   - Add proper context to errors with wrapping

4. **CLI Polish**
   - Complete the command implementation
   - Add proper help text and examples
   - Ensure consistent user experience

5. **Documentation**
   - Update CLI help text with examples
   - Ensure README reflects current capabilities
   - Add developer documentation for extensibility
